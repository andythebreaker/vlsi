when doing latch
if use two nor to make sr_latch
-> q will be q and p will be q_bar

but if use two nand to make sr_latch
it will be up side down

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this is wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the prob. that cause q and p different (up side down)
is that ::->
in the same row puts :: r and q (is wright)
if put s and q in the same row will get -> up side down
